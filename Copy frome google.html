the 13th century A.D. the Buddhists and Hindus were swamped by the
flood of Muslim conquerors and the tide of Islam up to 18th century.
Sometimes there were independent rulers like the Hussain Shahi and
Ilyas Shahi dynasties, while at other times they ruled on behalf of the
Imperial seat of Delhi.<br><br>From the 15th century, the Europeans,
namely Portuguese, Dutch, French and British traders exerted an
economic influence over the region. British political rule over the
region began in 1757 A.D., when the last Muslim ruler of Bengal was
defeated at Palassey. In 1947 the subcontinent was partitioned into
India and Pakistan. Present Bangladesh became the Eastern Wing of the
then Pakistan. But the movement for autonomy of East Pakistan started
within a couple of years because of language and cultural differences
and economic disparity between the two wings.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Language Movement</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>The
Language Movement of 1952 to recognize Bangla as a state language may
be termed as the first step towards independence.Political and economic
deprivation of the Bengalees prompted Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, the Father of the Nation, to put forward in 1966 his historic
six points, the "Magna Carta" which in effect structured the foundation
for East Pakistan's future independence.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The War of Liberation</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>In
the 1970 elections, even though the Awami League emerged as the largest
party in Pakistan Parliament, it was not allowed to form the government
by the ruling military junta. In the backdrop of a non-cooperation
movement launched against the military regime by Awami League.<br><br>Bangabandhu
declared at a historic public meeting held at Ramna Race Course
(renamed Suhrawardy Uddyan) on 7 March, 1971, attended by around 2
million people, "The struggle this tune is the struggle for freedom,
the struggle this tune is the struggle for independence." It was a
defacto declaration of independence.<br><br>Thus in a preplanned manner
on 25th March 1971. The Pakistan army embarked on what may be termed as
history's worst genocide. A military crackdown was ordered, and
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib was arrested and taken away to West Pakistan.
But just before he was arrested he sent out a call for the liberation
war to begin. Known as the Declaration of (lie War of Independence,
this hurriedly written historic document read as follows:<br>"Pak Army
suddenly attacked EPR Base at Pilkhana, Rajarbagh Police Line and
killing citizens. Street battles are going on in every street of Dacca.
Chittagong. I appeal to the nations of the world for help. Our freedom
fighters are gallantly fighting with the enemies to free the
motherland. I appeal and order you all in the name of Almighty Allah to
fight to the last drop of blood to liberate the country. Ask Police,
EPR, Bengal Regiment and Ansar to stand by you and to fight. No
compromise. Victory is ours. Drive out the enemies from the holy soil
of motherland. Convey this message to all Awami League leaders, workers
and other patriots and lovers of freedom. May Allah bless you. Joy
Bangla".<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Independence</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>After
nine months of war, the Pakistani occupation forces surrendered in
Dhaka on 16th December. 1971 after killing an estimated three million
people. Due to the heroic resistance and supreme sacrifices of the
valiant freedom fighters Bangladesh finally became an independent
sovereign state.<br><br>Father of the Nation Bangahandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman was the founder- president of Bangladesh. He was subsequently
assassinated on 15th August, 1975 by a group of conspirators.</td></tr><tr><td><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical Background<br><br></span></big>Remnants
of civilization in the greater Bengal region date back four thousand
years, when the region was settled by Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, and
Austro-Asiatic peoples. The exact origin of the word `Bangla&#8217; or
`Bengal&#8217; is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from Bang
(Sanskrit Vanga), the Dravidian-speaking tribe that settled in the area
around the year 1000 BC.<br>The Kingdom of Gangaridai was founded as
early as in the seventh century BC, which later merged with Bihar under
the Magadha, Nanda, Mauryan and Sunga Empires. Bengal was later part of
the Gupta Empire and Harsha Empire from the third to the sixth
centuries AD. Following its collapse, a dynamic Bangalee named
Shashanka founded an impressive yet short-lived kingdom. Shashanka is
considered the first independent king in the history of Bangladesh.
After a period of anarchy, the Buddhist Pala dynasty ruled the region
for four hundred years commonly referred to as the `Golden Age of
Bengal&#8217;. This was followed by a shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty.<br>Islam
was introduced to Bengal in the twelfth century by Arab Muslim
merchants and Sufi missionaries, and subsequent Muslim conquests helped
spread Islam throughout the region. Bakhtiar Khilji, a Turkic general,
defeated Lakshman Sen of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of
Bengal in the year 1204.<br><img style="width: 500px; height: 340px;" alt="Mujibnagar Monument" src="mujibnagarmonument.png"><br><br>The
region was ruled by dynasties of Sultans and land lord Bhuiyans for the
next few hundred years. By the 16th century, the Mughal Empire
controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of
the Mughal administration.<br>European traders arrived late in the 15th
century, and their influence grew until the British East India Company
gained control of Bengal following the Battle of Palashi in 1757. The
bloody rebellion of 1857, known as the Sepoy Mutiny, resulted in
transfer of authority to the Crown, with a British viceroy running the
administration in British India.<br>Between 1905 and 1911, an abortive
attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones, with
Dhaka as the capital of the eastern zone. When India was partitioned in
1947 Bengal was partitioned again along religious lines with the
western part going to India and the eastern part joining Pakistan as
province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan), with its
capital in Dhaka. Dissatisfaction with the Centre over economic and
cultural issues continued to rise even from the days of partition
through the 1950s and 1960s, during which the Awami League emerged as
the political voice of the Bangalees under the leadership of
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.<br><img style="width: 501px; height: 334px;" alt="Great Martyrs Sculpture" src="sculpturegreatmartyrs.png"><br><br>The
6-points programme launched by Bangabandhu in 1966 crystallised into
the demand for autonomy which led to the electoral victory for Awami
League in the first ever general election in Pakistan in 1970.
Following putting off the summoning of Parliament and consequent
decline to hand over power by Pakistani Junta, Bangabandhu made his
historic declaration on 7 March, 1971 about the struggle for freedom
and the struggle for independence. In the early hours of 26th March
1971, as the Pakistan Army unleashed its genocide across Bangladesh,
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman formally declared the independence of
Bangladesh and directed everyone to fight till the elimination of the
last soldier of the Pakistan Army. Awami League leaders set up a
provisional government, which formally took oath at Mujib Nagar in
Kushtia district inside Bangladesh on 17 April 1971. The War of
Liberation that started with the resistance on 26 March lasted for nine
months. The Mukti Bahini (freedom force) was made up of Bangalee
regulars and guerrillas. More than 3 million Bangalees were martyred
and millions were injured during the war of liberation. The war ended
in a decisive victory for Bangladesh when the Pakistan Army surrendered
to the joint command of Bangladesh-India forces on 16 December 1971.<br>When
a war ravaged country was going through massive reconstruction and
rehabilitation efforts and marching forward as an independent, secular
country to fulfill the aspirations of the people, on 15 August 1975,
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was brutally murdered along with most
of his family members by military adventurists and elements opposed to
the guiding ethos of our freedom movement and the tide of history was
turned back.<br>A series of bloody coups and counter-coups in the
following three months saw the ascent to power of Maj. Gen. Ziaur
Rahman, who founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and
reinstated religion based sectarian politics. General Zia&#8217;s rule ended
when he was assassinated in 1981 by&nbsp; elements of the military. Lt.
Gen. Hossain Mohammad Ershad assumed power in a bloodless coup in 1982
and ruled until 1990, when he was forced to resign in the face of a
popular anti-autocratic movement. Since then, Bangladesh has reverted
to a parliamentary democracy.<br>In the wake of rampant corruption,
disorder and uncertainty about the credibility of general election
under a caretaker government that conducted itself in a clearly
partisan manner, on 11 January 2007, a new caretaker government was
appointed to administer the next general election. The new caretaker
government held the general election on 29 December 2008 which were
acknowledged internationally as free, fair and credible. The grand
alliance led by the Awami League won the election with a landslide
victory and formed the government on 6 January 2009.<br>In the wake of
successful completion of the term of the Awami League led Government in
2013, a new free and fair election took place on 5 January 2014. The
people of the country reiterated their faith in democracy and the
politics of development led by Sheikh Hasina. The grand alliance led by
the Awami League won a landslide victory in the election and formed the
government to continue her progressive politics of development.<br>The
5 January 2014 election victory of the grand alliance led by the Awami
League has been a reiteration of the people&#8217;s faith in democracy and a
celebration of an inclusive, secular ethos.<br><img style="width: 501px; height: 351px;" alt="National Monument Savar" src="nationalmemorialsavar.png"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br></td>
